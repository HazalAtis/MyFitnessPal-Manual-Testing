# MyFitnessPal Manual Testing Project

This project showcases a beginner-level manual testing simulation of the **MyFitnessPal mobile app**, focusing on common QA documentation deliverables.

The goal is to practice test case design, bug reporting, and basic validation steps for a health and fitness tracking app ‚Äî mimicking real-world QA work in regulated environments like medical devices.

---

## Project Objectives

- Explore key features of the MyFitnessPal app
- Create formal test documentation
- Build a QA portfolio artifact suitable for entry-level testing roles

---

## Tested Features

- **Login & Authentication**  
- **Food Logging & Diary Management**  
- **Calorie Goal Setting**  
- **Daily Nutrition Summary**  
- **Water Intake Tracking**  

---

## Documentation

- [`MyFitnessPal_TestCases.docx`](./MyFitnessPal_TestCases.docx)  
  A formal set of 5 manually written test cases covering login, food logging, goal setting, and diary features. Each case includes preconditions, steps, expected results, and severity level.

- `BugReports_MyFitnessPal.docx` *(coming soon)*  
    Contains 5 detailed bug reports identified during manual testing. Each report includes environment, reproducibility, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual results, severity, priority, status, reporter, and date.

- `TestPlan_MyFitnessPal.docx` *(optional in future)*  
  May include scope, objectives, test strategy, environment, and risk-based testing focus.

  ## üßæ JIRA-Based Test & Bug Management

As part of this QA project, I created and maintained a professional testing workflow using **JIRA Software**, simulating real-world processes in a medical or healthcare software environment.

### üîπ JIRA Board Highlights

- üìå Project Name: **QA Portfolio ‚Äì MyFitnessPal**
- üõ†Ô∏è Managed 5 detailed **bug reports** with reproducible steps, severity, and environment info
- üß™ Created 2 complete **manual test cases** for login and food logging features
- üóÇÔ∏è Used clear issue types (`Bug`, `Task`) and organized labels:
  - `bug`, `test-case`, `manual-testing`, `food-logging`, `login`, `android`, `iOS`, `ui-issue`
- üìä Worked across all Jira workflow stages:  
  **To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done**

## üß™ Testing Types Covered in JIRA

This QA project includes documentation and issue tracking for five core testing types commonly used in manual software testing:

- **Smoke Testing** ‚Äì Confirmed app stability by verifying core flows like login and diary access  
- **Sanity Testing** ‚Äì Focused login flow tests after applying fixes  
- **Regression Testing** ‚Äì Re-tested core modules to ensure recent changes didn‚Äôt break existing functionality  
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** ‚Äì Simulated a real user journey to validate product readiness  
- **Exploratory Testing** ‚Äì Performed freestyle testing to discover hidden or edge-case issues

All testing types were tracked in JIRA using separate Task issues, proper labels, and a Kanban workflow (To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done).
