# MyFitnessPal Manual Testing Project

This project showcases a beginner-level manual testing simulation of the **MyFitnessPal mobile app**, focusing on common QA documentation deliverables.

The goal is to practice test case design, bug reporting, and basic validation steps for a health and fitness tracking app â€” mimicking real-world QA work in regulated environments like medical devices.
